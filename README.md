# SmartHome Hub

## Overview

This Flutter-based SmartHome Hub Application aims to revolutionize the smart home experience by providing a unified platform to control diverse smart devices. Many smart home gadgets, like Nest thermostats and Ring cameras, often lack compatibility with each other or with universal platforms like HomeKit. As a result, users juggle multiple apps to manage various aspects of their home automationâ€”adjusting Hue lights, locking doors, and setting room temperatures.

This application seeks to streamline this experience by serving as a comprehensive hub, allowing users to seamlessly control and monitor disparate smart home devices without switching between multiple apps.

## Key Features

- **Device Integration:** Bring together incompatible devices, such as Nest thermostats and Ring cameras, under one interface.
- **Unified Control:** Control various aspects of the smart home, including lights, door locks, temperature settings, and more.
- **Customization:** Personalize settings and create routines for different devices to enhance user convenience.

## How It Works

This application is built using the Flutter framework, ensuring cross-platform compatibility for both iOS and Android devices. It leverages API integrations and smart device protocols to establish communication and control functionalities across a wide array of smart home devices.
